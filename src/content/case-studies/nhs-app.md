## Designing a national healthcare platform used by millions

## Results at a glance

- **13 months** from project start to national rollout
- **37m+** users across England
- **56%** of the population signed up within the first 4.5 years
- **500m+** logins by August 2022
- **35m+** prescriptions ordered through the app within 5 years
- **1.5 million** missed appointments prevented
- **5.7 million** staff hours saved
- **£622 million** estimated savings to the NHS
- **12 million** fewer letters sent and significant reduction in SMS costs

## Context

The NHS App was created to give UK citizens secure digital access to healthcare services, including:

- viewing medical records
- booking and managing appointments
- ordering prescriptions
- accessing health advice and services

It was a high-stakes, nationally visible product built at pace, integrating with multiple legacy NHS systems and serving a wide demographic, from digitally confident users to those with limited digital literacy.

## Role & Context (BJSS)

I delivered this work while Head of Design at BJSS, a UK-based technology and engineering consultancy of around 1000 consultants working across government, health and financial services.

Alongside my client work, I was responsible for growing and leading the BJSS UX and design capability. During this period I:

- grew the design team from around 3 to ~20 designers
- built a distributed team embedded across clients across the UK
- set design culture, tools, standards and ways of working
- led ongoing hiring and recruitment across multiple regions
- balanced leadership responsibilities with billable delivery work

The NHS App was one of the most significant of these programmes — and the longest-running — where I led product design across the core experience.

## The challenge

This wasn’t a typical product build. The team had to balance:

**Complexity behind the scenes**  
Multiple existing NHS systems, inconsistent data, and fragmented service journeys.

**High trust requirements**  
Healthcare demands absolute clarity, privacy, accessibility and reliability.

**A diverse user base**  
From young, digital-first users to elderly patients and vulnerable groups.

**Speed of delivery**  
The product needed to be designed, validated and shipped quickly.

**Organisational alignment**  
Multiple stakeholders across NHS, government, clinical and technical teams.

## My role

As Design Lead on the NHS App (via BJSS), I worked at the intersection of product design, service design and delivery — helping the team move quickly while maintaining clarity and trust in a highly complex environment.

My responsibilities included:

- setting overall product design direction
- leading UX and interaction design across core journeys
- driving research and validation loops
- establishing rapid prototyping workflows
- working closely with product, engineering and service design
- acting as a bridge between BJSS delivery teams, NHS stakeholders and product leadership to align direction and unblock decisions

## Approach

### Make the complex feel simple
We treated clarity and trust as primary design goals:

- plain language over medical or system terminology
- clear hierarchy and predictable navigation
- simple, task-based journeys rather than system-based structures

Every decision was filtered through:

> “Would this make sense to someone who’s stressed, unwell or unfamiliar with technology?”

### Design the system, not just the screens
The NHS App is a layer across multiple services. We mapped end-to-end journeys and aligned the team on the full system to avoid fragmented solutions.

### Prototype fast, test constantly
Rapid cycles from concept to coded prototypes with user research every two weeks to validate and refine direction.

### Design for accessibility from the start
Accessibility treated as a core quality bar across contrast, navigation, structure and assistive technology support.

### Build trust through consistency
Consistent patterns across login, navigation, data and messaging to create clarity and confidence.

## Flagship feature: Organ Donation integration

We integrated the NHS Organ Donor Register directly into the NHS App so users can register, review and update their decision in real time.

This supported the shift to presumed consent, reduced friction in a sensitive journey and helped more than 500,000 people register their decision via the app.

This work was recognised with the HSJ Partnership Award for System and Data Integration (2020).

## Impact

The NHS App is now one of the most widely used digital healthcare products in the UK and a key part of the NHS’s shift from analogue to digital services.

### System-level impact
- **1.5 million** missed appointments prevented
- **5.7 million** staff hours saved (including 1.26m clinical hours)
- **£622 million** estimated savings
- reduced administrative burden across appointments, prescriptions and messaging

### Patient impact
- tens of millions of users accessing NHS services digitally
- faster access to appointments and treatment
- greater control over healthcare decisions and communication

### Operational impact
- **12 million** fewer letters sent
- major reduction in SMS and admin costs
- improved waiting time performance in trusts using app-enabled services

## What I learned

Designing at national scale is as much about alignment as it is about design.

Success came from:
- tight collaboration across product, service design and engineering
- clear shared artefacts and decision frameworks
- rapid, evidence-led iteration

It reinforced a belief I carry into all my work:

> “The best way to handle complexity is not to hide it — but to organise it so users don’t have to think about it.”

This project fundamentally shaped how I approach product design — balancing pace, complexity and trust in environments where the stakes genuinely matter.
