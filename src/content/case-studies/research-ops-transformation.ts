## Context and constraints

The design team had grown to 12 people across four product squads, but research remained ad-hoc. Some designers ran their own studies, others relied entirely on PM-led customer calls. There was no shared repository, no consistent methodology, and no visibility into what we collectively knew about our customers.

**Key constraints:**
- No budget for dedicated researchers initially
- Compliance requirements around customer data handling
- Designers already at capacity with delivery work
- Historical culture of "just ship and learn"

## The real problem

The surface request was "we need to do more research." But more research without infrastructure just creates more noise.

The real problem was that research happened, then disappeared. Insights lived in individual designers' heads, in scattered Notion pages, in forgotten Miro boards. We were repeatedly learning the same things and making the same mistakes.

We needed research to compound, not evaporate.

## My role and involvement

**Strategic:** Made the case that research capability was a competitive advantage. Calculated that we were losing roughly 15% of design and engineering effort to rework caused by late-discovered customer needs.

**Structural:** Designed the research operations model—what would be centralised (recruitment, repository, compliance) versus distributed (actual research execution by squads).

**Hands-on:** Personally built the first iteration of the research repository, established the tagging taxonomy, and ran the first three cross-squad synthesis sessions to model the behaviour I wanted to see.

## Decisions and trade-offs

**Enablement over centralisation.** Rather than hiring researchers to do research "for" squads, we built infrastructure that made designers better researchers. This was slower initially but created more durable capability.

**Repository before tools.** We invested in a simple but rigorous repository (Notion + standardised templates) before considering specialised research tools. The discipline of documentation mattered more than the tooling.

**Recruitment panel.** Established a standing panel of 200+ customers who'd opted in for research. This reduced recruitment time from 2 weeks to 2 days and democratised access to customers.

**Synthesis rituals.** Monthly cross-squad synthesis sessions where insights were shared and patterns identified. This created the connective tissue between squad-level learnings.

## How this scaled through people and process

I trained four designers as "research champions"—one per squad. They weren't responsible for doing all research, but for maintaining quality standards and contributing to the repository.

Created lightweight research templates that standardised what we captured without over-prescribing methodology. Squads could run whatever methods fit their questions, but outputs were consistently structured.

Established a tagging system based on user journey stages and problem themes. This made cross-cutting insights discoverable without requiring everyone to read everything.

## Outcomes and learning

**Measurable outcomes:**
- Time from research question to first customer conversation: 14 days → 3 days
- Research repository grew to 200+ studies in 18 months
- Rework attributed to customer misunderstanding reduced by 35%
- Designer confidence in research (surveyed) increased from 3.2/5 to 4.1/5

**What I learned:**

Research operations is infrastructure, not overhead. The goal isn't to add process—it's to remove friction from learning.

Compound knowledge is the goal. Individual studies matter less than the accumulated understanding across studies.

Designers can be excellent researchers when supported. The bottleneck wasn't capability—it was tooling, access, and permission.
