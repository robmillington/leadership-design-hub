## Building a modern UX function and product design capability from scratch

Helped build and lead a new Manchester-based UX team for Thomas Cook Airlines, establishing design systems, processes and culture while improving the core “search and book” journey and launching a new mobile app experience.

## Context

In 2018, Thomas Cook Airlines set out to modernise its digital customer experience and bring product design capability in-house.

A new UX team was being created in Manchester to replace and scale beyond an existing London-based contractor setup. At the same time, the business needed to continue delivering improvements to its core commercial journey and prepare for the launch of a new mobile app built on a new API platform.

I was brought in as part of the leadership group to build and lead the UX function, establish ways of working, and embed human-centred design into a traditional airline business.

## The challenge

This was a classic “build the plane while flying it” situation.

We needed to:

- stand up a brand new UX team and culture
- transition knowledge from a distributed contractor model
- continue business-as-usual delivery on revenue-critical journeys
- define new product patterns for a modern mobile app
- do all of this inside a large, operationally complex airline

At the same time, the organisation was not yet used to working with a dedicated UX function. Demand quickly outstripped capacity and prioritisation needed to be brought under control.

## My role

I led UX and product design for the Manchester team, with responsibility for:

- building and managing a 12-person UX and UI team embedded across agile squads
- defining design process, tooling and standards
- establishing a scalable design system and brand toolkit
- improving the “search and book” journey using data and research
- contributing to the design of the new Thomas Cook Airlines mobile app
- educating senior stakeholders and the wider business on user-centred design
- facilitating design sprints and discovery work with the C-suite

This was a leadership-heavy role, but I remained hands-on where needed, particularly around the design system, journey optimisation work, and key delivery moments.

## Building the team and culture

We were effectively starting from a blank slate.

We recruited and embedded designers into product squads, creating a cross-functional model that aligned design closely with product and engineering.

To support that, I led the creation of:

- a shared design process grounded in human-centred design
- clear rituals (stand-ups, weekly prioritisation, design critiques)
- and a strong team culture centred on collaboration and craft

We also introduced a physical Kanban workflow combined with weekly prioritisation sessions with product owners. This gave the team clarity, focus and a way to manage incoming demand without losing momentum.

One of the most important parts of the role was educating the wider organisation on how to work with design. This included running workshops, sharing work in progress, and demonstrating how design could reduce risk and improve outcomes.

## Design system and tooling

A key early investment was modernising our tooling and design infrastructure.

We moved the team to Figma, which allowed real-time collaboration across squads, shared components and faster iteration.

We paired this with a code-connected design system, documented in Zeroheight and aligned with the engineering Storybook library.

The aim was to create a single source of truth for:

- UI components
- interaction patterns
- brand usage
- and product design principles

This significantly reduced duplication, improved consistency, and accelerated delivery across squads.

## Improving the core journey

Alongside building the team and systems, we continued to improve the airline’s core commercial journey.

Using a mix of analytics and research, we iterated on key parts of the search and book experience, focusing on reducing friction, improving clarity of pricing and options, and simplifying navigation and decision-making.

Because the team was embedded in squads, we were able to move iteratively and deliver incremental improvements without disrupting ongoing delivery.

## Launching the mobile app experience

At the same time, we were designing a new native app built on a modern API platform.

The team developed a concept centred around time-based passenger needs, using a journey timeline and action cards to surface the most relevant information at each stage of travel.

Key principles included:

- showing only the most important action at any given time
- flattening navigation to make key information one tap away
- expressing the Thomas Cook brand through tone, motion and visual detail

This created a clear, extensible structure for delivering information and actions to passengers in a way that reduced stress and simplified the flying experience.

## Influencing at leadership level

One of the most impactful moments in the project was running a design sprint with the board and senior leadership team.

Within a single day, we took a hypothesis around improving the search experience, moved from ideas to prototype, and tested it with users.

This helped shift internal perception of design from a delivery function to a strategic capability that could move quickly, reduce risk and unlock new opportunities.

## Impact

In around nine months we:

- built and embedded a 12-person UX function into the organisation
- established a modern, collaborative design system and tooling stack
- improved key parts of the airline’s core revenue journey
- designed and validated a new mobile app experience
- introduced a human-centred design culture across the business

One of the most valuable outcomes was the team itself — a high-performing, collaborative group that many of us have continued to work with since.

## What I learned

This project reinforced that:

- building a great team and culture can be as impactful as the product itself
- design systems and design ops are critical enablers of quality and speed
- embedding designers in squads works, but only with clear process and prioritisation
- showing stakeholders how design works is often more powerful than telling them

## Closing note

Thomas Cook Airlines ceased trading in 2019, bringing a long history to an end. The airline itself remained one of the stronger parts of the group to the end.

The work we did there, and the team we built, remains one of the projects I’m most proud of.
