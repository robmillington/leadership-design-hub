## Context

Barclays serves roughly 20% of the UK adult population, with millions of customers interacting with its app and digital services daily.

I joined as Lead Product Designer and worked across two major initiatives:

**The Product Hub** — the primary route for customers to discover and adopt additional financial products

**Paid Banking Strategy** — exploring how Barclays could evolve beyond the UK's free banking model

Both areas were commercially important, highly complex, and heavily stakeholder-driven.

## The challenge

### 1. A high-traffic but under-optimised experience

The Product Hub sat at the centre of Barclays' growth model, but:

- had seen limited optimisation over time
- lacked personalisation
- had fragmented ownership across multiple product lines

Millions of customers passed through it, but it wasn't performing to its potential.

### 2. Complex internal ownership

Each product area (loans, mortgages, insurance, etc.) had its own:

- senior stakeholders
- commercial targets
- priorities and constraints

Improving the experience required alignment across multiple business units.

### 3. A difficult market reality

In the UK, free banking is the norm.

Shifting customers toward paid banking products required:

- a clear value proposition
- behavioural change
- careful positioning and trust-building

### 4. COVID disruption

All of this work began during the early stages of COVID, making:

- alignment harder
- delivery slower
- stakeholder availability unpredictable

## My role

As Lead Product Designer, I worked at the intersection of:

- product strategy
- customer experience
- commercial performance

My responsibilities included:

- Building the business case for improving the Product Hub
- Combining customer research, market insight and business needs
- Creating a roadmap for change
- Aligning senior stakeholders across multiple product lines
- Bootstrapping a cross-functional team to deliver improvements
- Later, shaping the paid banking strategy and experience direction

## Approach

### 1. Start with evidence, not opinion

I brought together:

- existing market research
- internal performance data
- customer insight
- stakeholder goals

This created a shared understanding of the problem space and a neutral starting point for discussions.

### 2. Reframe the Product Hub as a growth platform

Rather than treating it as a static page, we positioned the Product Hub as:

**A core growth engine for the bank**

We identified opportunities around:

- personalisation
- relevance of offers
- clearer product education
- better timing within the customer journey

### 3. Build a clear, phased roadmap

Given the scale of the organisation, change had to be incremental and realistic.

I created a roadmap that:

- balanced quick wins with longer-term transformation
- aligned to commercial objectives
- could be owned by multiple teams

This made it easier for stakeholders to commit and invest.

### 4. Align stakeholders through clarity and momentum

The Product Hub had previously struggled to gain traction.

To move it forward, I:

- ran focused design and strategy sessions
- created clear artefacts showing the future state
- used early concepts to make the opportunity tangible

This helped convert stakeholder interest into active support and resourcing.

### 5. Form and launch the delivery team

Once aligned, I helped:

- define the team structure
- clarify ownership across product areas
- establish a design and delivery approach

Bootstrapping a new initiative in a large bank, during COVID, required persistence and clarity.

## Paid Banking Strategy

After establishing momentum on the Product Hub, I was asked to move onto a more complex challenge:

**How could Barclays increase adoption of paid banking products in a market dominated by free banking?**

This work involved:

- combining market research, behavioural insight and internal strategy
- understanding customer motivations and barriers
- defining a clearer value proposition for paid tiers
- exploring how the product experience needed to evolve

The work required a fundamental rethink of how paid banking was positioned and delivered within Barclays.

## Outcome

Before I left Barclays to join Awaze:

- The Product Hub initiative was resourced and underway, with a clear roadmap and aligned stakeholders
- A dedicated team had been established to deliver the improvements
- The paid banking strategy direction had been defined and handed over for delivery

From the outside, Barclays has since executed much of this direction in line with the original strategic approach.

## Impact

While I was not there for final delivery, the work:

- Unblocked a long-stalled but commercially critical product area
- Created alignment across multiple senior stakeholder groups
- Established a clear direction for growth and optimisation
- Laid the foundations for future product and commercial innovation

## What I learned

In large organisations, progress depends less on the "right idea" and more on alignment, timing and clarity.

This project reinforced that:

- strong product design leadership often means bringing structure to complexity
- influencing stakeholders is as important as designing interfaces
- momentum is built through clear direction and early, tangible progress

This experience deepened my interest in working at the intersection of product, commercial strategy and organisational design — and shaped how I approach complex product ecosystems today.
