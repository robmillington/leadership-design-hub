## Overview
Leading product design across Cottages.com, Hoseasons, and Novasol. Supporting a platform handling ~300k daily sessions across multiple brands.

## Key Outcomes
- Built and scaled a shared multi-brand design system improving delivery speed and consistency.
- Introduced research operations and experimentation practices to support optimisation and decision-making.
- Partnered with product leadership on roadmap, funnel performance, and strategic initiatives.

## Strategy & Leadership
My focus is connecting design to measurable business outcomes. That includes improving conversion, increasing customer lifetime value, and building product capabilities that scale across brands and markets.

I’ve spent the last few years operating close to product leadership, contributing to roadmap direction, experimentation strategy and organisational design. My role often sits between design, product and engineering, helping align vision with delivery.
