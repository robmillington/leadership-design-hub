summary: "On the difference between managing certainty and leading through uncertainty—and why senior design leadership is mostly the latter."

There's a particular kind of discomfort that comes with senior design leadership. It's not the discomfort of not knowing what to do—that's junior. It's the discomfort of knowing that there *isn't* a right answer, and you have to act anyway.

Early in my career, I thought seniority meant having more answers. Now I understand it means being comfortable with fewer answers but better questions.

## The certainty trap

Product organisations crave certainty. Roadmaps. Timelines. Specifications. Success metrics. This craving is understandable—certainty is how we coordinate large groups of people toward shared goals.

But design work, particularly at the strategic level, is fundamentally about reducing uncertainty. We research to understand. We prototype to learn. We test to validate. If we already knew the answers, we wouldn't need design.

The trap is when we pretend certainty exists when it doesn't. When we present a design as "the solution" rather than "our current best hypothesis." When we hide the questions behind polished deliverables.

I've learned to be explicit about confidence levels. "I'm 80% confident this interaction model will work because of X. I'm 40% confident about the visual treatment because we haven't tested it yet." This isn't hedging—it's precision.

## Three kinds of ambiguity

Not all uncertainty is the same, and leading through it requires recognising what you're dealing with.

**Solvable ambiguity** is when we don't know something, but we could. We haven't done the research, run the test, or asked the customer. The leadership move here is to resist premature closure—to say "we don't know yet" and create the conditions to find out.

**Structural ambiguity** is when the organisation hasn't decided something, and design can't proceed without it. Should we serve enterprise or SMB? Is this a platform or a product? These aren't design questions, but design often surfaces them. The leadership move is to escalate clearly and resist the temptation to make organisational decisions through design decisions.

**Inherent ambiguity** is when there genuinely isn't a right answer. Trade-offs are real. Constraints conflict. Reasonable people disagree. The leadership move here is to make a call, document the reasoning, and create mechanisms to revisit it.

## The courage of conviction (loosely held)

Senior design leadership requires a specific kind of intellectual courage: the ability to hold strong convictions loosely.

Strong convictions because you have to move people. Designers, engineers, stakeholders—they're looking to you for direction. "I don't know" repeated too often erodes confidence. You have to synthesise available information into a point of view and advocate for it.

Loosely held because you're often wrong. New information emerges. Contexts shift. What looked obvious in the strategy meeting looks naive after customer research. You have to model intellectual honesty—showing your team that changing your mind in response to evidence is strength, not weakness.

This is exhausting. Every strong opinion I express, I'm mentally tagging with "until proven otherwise." Every design review, I'm distinguishing between "this violates our principles" and "this violates my taste." Every strategy conversation, I'm trying to separate "I believe this" from "I can prove this."

## The work is the team

The longer I lead design organisations, the more I understand that my primary output isn't design. It's the conditions under which good design happens.

When my team navigates ambiguity well—when they make thoughtful calls, when they surface the right questions, when they change course gracefully—that's the work. My role is to model the behaviour, provide the frameworks, and create psychological safety for the inevitable mistakes.

Ambiguity isn't a problem to be solved. It's the medium we work in. And leading through it isn't about having answers—it's about building the organisational muscle to find them together.
