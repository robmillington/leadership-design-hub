I recently read [Figma’s latest research](https://www.figma.com/blog/why-demand-for-designers-is-on-the-rise/) on design hiring and one stat stuck with me: 82% of organisations say their need for designers has either stayed the same or increased.

That runs counter to what a lot of designers are feeling right now. Layoffs over the last couple of years, tools getting more capable by the month, whole workflows being automated. It’s easy to assume the role is being squeezed out.

But when you look at what’s actually happening inside organisations, the picture is different. AI is compressing production. It’s making it dramatically easier to generate output. Layouts, flows, copy, variants, entire journeys can be created in minutes.

Which means the constraint is no longer “can we make something?”. The constraint is now “should we make this, and is it actually good?”.

That’s a different problem. And it shifts the centre of gravity in design.

Figma’s data reflects that. Hiring managers are prioritising product strategy, systems thinking, collaboration, visual polish, and increasingly something harder to define but easy to recognise: taste and judgement. The things that rely on context, experience and accountability. The things that don’t automate neatly.

AI can generate options. It can’t take responsibility for what ships.

From my own conversations with other design leaders in the UK over the last six months, this absolutely matches what they’re seeing. Teams aren’t reducing design capability. They’re trying to strengthen it. The ask is less about output and more about judgement, direction and quality.

I’m seeing the same inside our own business at Awaze. As AI tools have become part of the workflow, the need for clear product thinking, consistent design systems, and strong design leadership has increased, not reduced. The volume of ideas has gone up. The need to decide which ones are worth pursuing has gone up even faster.

So the role of the designer doesn’t disappear. It becomes more exposed. More visible. And more important.

The other interesting signal in the research is where demand is coming from. The companies growing the fastest are the ones investing most heavily in design.

That’s not because they want nicer interfaces. It’s because they understand how design functions inside a modern product organisation.

Design is how you test ideas before you spend months building them. It’s how you translate a strategy into something customers can understand. It’s how you reduce risk and move with confidence. And it’s one of the few levers you have to differentiate in markets where most products are functionally similar.

AI amplifies all of that. It allows teams to explore more directions, faster. But without strong design leadership, that speed just creates more noise. More concepts, more partial solutions, more things that look plausible but don’t hold together.

That’s why we’re seeing a clear shift towards senior hires. More than half of hiring managers in the study are prioritising senior designers, compared to a quarter hiring for junior roles.

It’s not a rejection of junior talent. The best teams still need a mix of perspectives and experience. But when the problem space expands, you need people who can make calls with incomplete information, who understand commercial constraints, who can align stakeholders, and who can keep quality high while the pace increases.

That’s a leadership skill set. Not just a production one.

And interestingly, at the same time, core craft is becoming more visible again. Visual polish is still cited as one of the most important skills. That makes sense. If everyone can generate a UI, then quality becomes the differentiator. Does it feel coherent? Does it feel trustworthy? Does it actually communicate what the product does? Does it reflect the brand in a meaningful way?

Those things come from judgement. They come from experience. And they come from someone being accountable for the final product, not just the process that created it.

The risk in all of this isn’t AI itself. It’s how organisations choose to use it.

There’s a version of the future where AI is used to justify lowering the bar. Shipping faster without thinking. Removing research and validation. Producing more output but learning less. In that world, you don’t need designers. You just need operators moving things through a system.

But the companies that win won’t operate like that. The data already shows it. The organisations growing fastest are using design to move quicker, but also to make better decisions. They’re using AI to accelerate exploration, but relying on designers to decide what’s worth building and to make sure it actually works for real people.

That has implications for designers too. The skills that are increasing in value aren’t just tool-based. They’re about how you operate in a business context. Understanding how the product makes money. Understanding how different parts of the experience connect. Being able to communicate clearly with product, engineering and commercial stakeholders. Being able to form and defend a point of view about what good looks like.

AI fluency matters. It will become table stakes. But on its own it’s not a differentiator. It’s just part of the toolkit.

The designers who will do well over the next few years are the ones who combine that toolkit with judgement, taste, and the ability to connect design decisions to outcomes.

In other words, the job is becoming less about making things and more about deciding what to make, why it matters, and whether it’s actually good enough to put in front of customers.

AI hasn’t changed the nature of those problems. It’s just made them harder to ignore.

And that’s why, despite everything, demand for designers isn’t going down. It’s going up.
